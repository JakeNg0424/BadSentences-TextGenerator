# Bad Sentences

This text generator makes a new poorly written sentence everytime you re-roll the program. Sometimes the sentences makes sense and sometime it becomes a jumble of words. But every re-roll, you're guarantee there is a rhyme one.

I wanted to make a joke generator based off of "An Apple a Day / Keeps the Doctor Away". Unfortunately, I would need to edit the generator's code to compare rhyme schemes. In the end, I went the cheap route and force every phrase to end rhyming with 'day'.

My hopes for the future is to update this project so there would be unique rhymes. This could be achieved with simple if-statements to compare an array of words. Putting all similar rhymes in one array and calling them to match the other.
